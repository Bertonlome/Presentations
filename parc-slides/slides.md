# THE FUTURE OF PROGRAMMING
<span class="kicker">DBX — July 9, 1973</span>

Notes:
- Open with the “computer is a medium” thesis.
- Promise: concrete examples, not just slogans.

<section class="slide--section">

  <h1>Thesis</h1>
</section>

## Axiom
Tools should **amplify thought**, not merely **automate tasks**.

- Media shape ideas we are able to express.
- When the medium is *wrong*, progress stalls.

Notes:
- Name-check Engelbart / PARC lineage.
- Tie to audience’s domain in one sentence.

---

## Constraint → Consequence
- If our medium is **static documents**, we get **passive thinking**.  
- With **live, malleable representations**, we get **interactive reasoning**.

<div class="footnote">
Example: spreadsheets vs. narrative memos; live models vs. slide bullets.
</div>

Notes:
- Keep tempo brisk; 20–30s per bullet.
- Gesture the contrast (static vs. live) with a quick demo if possible.

  <h1>Three Shifts</h1>
</section>

---

## 1) From Describing → to Manipulating
- Not *about* the system — **touch the system**.  
- Visibility → Directability → Predictability.

Notes:
- Briefly define O/D/P if relevant (HAT tie-in).

---

## 2) From Artifacts → to Media
- Programs as **materials** we shape.  
- Code as **communication** with ourselves.

---

## 3) From Solo → to Situated
- Tools are **social** and **spatial**.  
- Interfaces should model **teams**, not users.

---

<section class="slide--section">
  <div class="rule"></div>
  <h1>Implication</h1>
</section>

---

## Design Principle
**One idea per slide.**  
Prefer **clear sentences** over decorative graphics.

<div class="blockquote">
“Show me a medium and I will show you the kinds of thoughts it makes possible.”
</div>

Notes:
- Keep this slide up while you speak ~45s.

---

## What To Do Monday
- Replace bullet decks with **live documents**.  
- Make the **model visible**.  
- Bias for **manipulability** over reporting.

Notes:
- End with a concrete invitation.
