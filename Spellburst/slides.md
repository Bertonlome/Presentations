Tyler Angert
Replit, Inc. → Patina Systems
    • Affiliations: Founder & CEO of Patina Systems (2024–Present) – building “spontaneous software” tools for custom everyday apps[1]. Formerly the first Product Designer at Replit (2019–2024), where he led design of the IDE[2]. Also collaborated with the MIT Media Lab on Scratch (kids coding platform) as a research prototyper[3].
    • Education: Ed.M. in Technology, Innovation & Education from Harvard University; B.S. in Mathematics & Computer Science from Emory University[2].
    • Interests: Passionate about creative tools and user empowerment – interested in self-expression, communication, operating systems, and web browsers[1]. His work centers on designing interfaces that blur the line between software users and creators.
    • Notable Projects: Led the design of Replit’s now-legendary online IDE[4] and co-authored Spellburst (UIST 2023), an LLM-driven creative coding interface that bridges natural language prompts with code for generative art[5]. He also holds a patent on a “Multiplayer Debugger” for collaborative coding[6].

Miroslav Suzara
Stanford University (PhD Candidate)
    • Affiliation: Ph.D. candidate in Learning Sciences and Technology Design (Graduate School of Education) and M.S. student in Computer Science at Stanford University[9]. (Admitted 2018; currently in final stages of doctoral program.)
    • Research Interests: Focused on human-AI collaboration in learning contexts – exploring how AI systems can support and enhance human teamwork, learning, and creativity[9]. His work spans educational technology, collaborative learning methods, and human-AI interaction to extend human capabilities[10].
    • Notable Work: Equal first author of Spellburst (UIST 2023), which introduced a prompt-driven creative coding tool integrating semantic prompts with code editing[5]. Also co-authored “The GPT Surprise” (2024), a study on offering ChatGPT in a large coding class (finding reduced student engagement but improved exam performance)[11].
    • Online Presence: Personal site miroslavsuzara.com – shares research projects and publications[12]. Contributor to open-source on GitHub and active in academic communities (e.g. ACM Learning Sciences).

Jenny Han
Stanford University → Khan Academy
    • Experience: Current: Prompt Engineer at Khan Academy, building and testing AI-powered tools for teachers[13]. Previous: Web Developer at UCI’s Design & Partnership Lab, Product Engineering Intern at Replit, Lead Instructional Designer at Next Shift Learning, and a Stanford CS106B course Lecturer[14]. She was also a Fulbright Research Scholar in 2019, focusing on online learning platforms in rural China[15].
    • Education: B.S. in Symbolic Systems from Stanford (an interdisciplinary major in CS, linguistics, psychology, and philosophy), and an M.S. in Computer Science (HCI specialization) from Stanford, with a focus on learning technologies[16].
    • Research & Interests: Combines education and technology (“equal parts ed + tech”) to design personally meaningful learning experiences[17]. Research keywords include computer science education, child-computer interaction, co-design, and generative AI in learning[18]. She is passionate about creating tools that transform how people learn and teach.
    • Notable Projects: Co-first author of Spellburst (LLM-powered creative coding tool for artists, UIST 2023)[5]. Earlier, contributed to StoryCoder (voice-guided coding for kids, CHI 2021) and other HCI education research (multiple best paper awards)[19].
    • Online: Personal website jennylihan.com – features her blog, research publications, and design projects[20][21]. Also active on LinkedIn and GitHub, and occasionally on X (Twitter) sharing insights on learning design.

Christopher Pondoc
Stanford University (BS & MS ’24)
    • Education: Recently graduated from Stanford University with a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science (completed coterminally in 2024)[22]. Academic interests centered on artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction.
    • Industry Experience: During his studies, he interned as a software engineer at Splunk and Coinbase, working on large-scale software systems[22]. He also conducted machine learning research (including projects with Stanford AI Lab and HCI Group) and earned awards for course projects in AI[23][24].
    • Research & Projects: Co-author of Spellburst (UIST 2023) – contributing to the development of the LLM-driven generative art tool[5]. His research work spans information retrieval and ML; for example, he worked on “Bridging the Gulf of Envisioning”, examining cognitive challenges in prompt-based AI interactions[25].
    • Entrepreneurship: Founded a startup called Vita EDO (2018–2020), where he served as CEO building an educational technology platform[26]. He has remained active in the tech startup scene at Stanford (e.g. programs with venture funds and incubators)[27].
    • Online: Personal website cpondoc.com – highlights his writings and projects[27]. Also reachable via GitHub and LinkedIn (where he was noted as a “multifaceted” software engineer with diverse interests in ML and innovation[28][29]).

Hariharan Subramonyam
Stanford University (Assistant Professor)
    • Position: Assistant Professor (Research) at Stanford’s Graduate School of Education, with a courtesy appointment in Computer Science[30]. He is also a Ram and Vijay Shriram Faculty Fellow at Stanford’s Human-Centered AI Institute (HAI) and a core faculty member of the Stanford HCI group[31]. (He joined Stanford after completing his PhD in 2020.)
    • Background: Ph.D. in Information Science from the University of Michigan, where he was advised by Prof. Eytan Adar[32]. His academic training combines HCI, learning sciences, and data science.
    • Research Focus: Sits at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Learning Sciences[33]. His work seeks to augment human learning with AI by using cognitively-informed design, co-designing with educators/learners, and creating transformative AI-driven learning experiences[33]. He emphasizes ethical, human-centered design in AI tools for education.
    • Notable Contributions: Principal investigator of projects on AI in education and creativity. Senior author of Spellburst (UIST 2023), which demonstrated a novel interface merging semantic prompts with code for creative coding[5]. His research has earned awards (e.g. Best Paper at CHI 2025) and featured in an ACM Interactions cover story on UX in responsible AI[34].
    • Online: Personal website haridecoded.com – includes his publications, news (e.g. awards and grants), and writings on human-AI interaction[35][32]. Active on X (Twitter) as @HariSubramonyam and Google Scholar for research updates.
